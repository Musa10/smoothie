## Features

- Execute any workflow exported from React Flow.
- Supports sequential task execution (`start`, `task`, `end` nodes).
- Async workflow execution.
- Lightweight, Go-native backend engine.
- Simple HTTP API to start workflows.

- **Workflow Engine**: Parses nodes and edges, executes tasks sequentially.
- **HTTP API**: Accepts React Flow JSON via POST requests.
- **In-memory Execution**: Tracks node status (`pending`, `running`, `completed`) without external DB (optional later).
